# SE-Assignment-4
Assignment: GitHub and Visual Studio
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of GitHub and Visual Studio. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Introduction to GitHub:

What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development.
  - Github is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. Github support collaborative software development by allowing multiple people to view and make changes and send it back so that everyone can read and make comments in real time.
Repositories on GitHub:

What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it.
-Repository is a space that you place your code and to see the history of the code and to create one you should login into your github account and go to your anvigation if you dont see it uin the home page and click repository and click the new button, than fill in all the neccessary information like name of the repo etc.
Version Control with Git:

Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
-Version control in Git is essential in collaborative developmet as it shows the history and changes in the code. Github enhances it for developers by making it easier to do as it is in text form
Branching and Merging in GitHub:

What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
-Branches in Github are a contained area where you as a developer can experiment new ideas in your repo. Creatung branches you would need to go to the repo and search for the main branch icon and click on the new branch than fill in the name of the branch the source etc than click create, when deleting it you just click next to the branch to delete it and use a pull request to merge the branches 
Pull Requests and Code Reviews:

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
- Pull request is an action to merge branches into one branch. In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase. You can do a pull request by going into the branch and see a yellow banner and click compare and pull button and create a pull request.
GitHub Actions:

Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Github Actions are applications used to assist in the work flow and they are used for example ro redue repetitive code in your program etc.

-Visual Studio is an IDE or coding/developer platform where you can create different progrmas using different languages its key feature is it edits, debug, and build code and publish an app. It differs from vs code as it is only for C++.
Integrating GitHub with Visual Studio:

Describe the steps to integrate a GitHub repository with Visual Studio. How does this integration enhance the development workflow?
-To integrate a Git hub repo i with vscode is to first login in vscode with your github account , than you can search for the repo in the search bar and start working. The workflow is enhanced as it is allowing you working in one environment making sure all steps(commit, push) are done without needing to migrate to another platform.
Debugging in Visual Studio:

Explain the debugging tools available in Visual Studio. How can developers use these tools to identify and fix issues in their code?
- Buggy code is something that happens when coding and VS has extensions and features to combat this so that you will not need to spend hours trying to find the issue only to see that you missed a comma on a line of code, there is a Run and Debug feature on vscode which helps find bugs in the code.
Collaborative Development using GitHub and Visual Studio:

Discuss how GitHub and Visual Studio can be used together to support collaborative development. Provide a real-world example of a project that benefits from this integration.
-Github and visual studio use in a collaborative development as gitbash is intergrated into the vs terminal which allows people to add, commit and push changes made in the code without needing to exit the coding environment which makes things easier and faster for example in plp development class i can clone or open the assignment on vscode and after completing the assignment i can push it back to gitclub and send a link to my instructers.
